Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for
mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing
code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free
and open source.

## About Flutter

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model.

### Beautiful user experiences

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the
screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

### Productive development

Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.
